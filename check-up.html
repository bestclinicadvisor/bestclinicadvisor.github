    <h2>
        REASON FOR HAVING A CHECK-UP EXAMINATION
    </h2>
        <P>Many diseases affecting the human body can be treated or controlled to some extent thanks to early diagnosis.
         Eliminating minor health problems as early as possible by taking necessary precautions can prevent
          them from turning into more serious issues and chronic diseases in the future.
        </P>
         <P>However, most types of diseases can only be detected 
            during routine health examinations,
             as they do not cause significant early symptoms. 
             Therefore, it is very important for all 
             individuals to undergo regular health check-ups without waiting to feel symptoms or discomfort. 
             During these general health examinations, called check-ups, 
             a personalized screening plan is 
             determined by taking into account personal health status, 
             genetic risk factors, age, height, weight, gender, and patient history.
        </P>
        <P>Necessary screening tests can then be performed, 
            and information about your overall health status can be determined.
        </P>
